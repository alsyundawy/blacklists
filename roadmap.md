## Roadmap

Could be nice if some missions will be achieved:

- Check the web for more blacklists to be aggregated when possible
- Whitelist content can be improved
- Adult and newly registered domains are a huge challenge to manage on separate aggregated blacklists, postponed..
- IP blacklists integration (get FQDNs from blacklisted IPs and provide a custom FQDN  list to include in the main one)
- Domain ranking insights is a topic, should be a fail and learn initiative
- Improve documentation and website UX (especially for non techie users)
- Fix and learn from everything
