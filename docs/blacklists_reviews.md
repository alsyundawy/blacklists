# Blacklists reviews

- Blacklists monitor is [here](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/blacklists/blob/main/blacklists_monitor.md)
- The aim of the review sessions is to mantain a fresh, optimal, useful aggregated blacklist
- If a blacklist source is not updated in the latest 72 hours will be flagged as "dormient", more time and will be removed from the list
- If a blacklist raise up again after some time will be carefully reviewed before to be combined
- Reviews must be run every 3 months to mantain a proper valuable blacklist data

Keep in mind that the blacklists urls file is continuously updated manually and the review sessions just save time to this process.
